INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (1,'Cliptales wordpress theme for cliptales.com','<p>Couple of weeks back, I got an awesome requirement from my brother(Anand Saha) of building a web application which will be used to personalize the way images are displayed. This is what we came up with <a href=\"http://cliptales.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://cliptales.com.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t we have many of them ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually no. The intention was to pull to images from Instagram and sync it with wordpress database. There are plugins available which can do this but they have the below limitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If the images are being pulled by ajax, they will never be seen by crawlers and so no SEO.</li>\r\n	<li>If they are being pulled by php/ajax, all image items, comments, likes will be linked to instagram. I wanted to retain the visitors and not redirect them.</li>\r\n	<li>No search/filter/sorting options.</li>\r\n	<li>Each image cannot have there independent page. They will always be displayed in a grid in one page.</li>\r\n	<li>No way to publish to other social networks where your site will be highlighted.</li>\r\n	<li>Doesn&rsquo;t provide a rich experience to mobile users.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So I decided to create a cliptales theme from scratch that will have all the options and which will be pretty optimized and responsive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cliptales solves all the above issues. It is capable to do an optimized sync within few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does the theme sync with Instagram ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Instagram is very interesting but at the same time it can make you insane. Instagram doesn&rsquo;t provide you with all images of a user in one go. It provides you 20 per request and along with that, it gives you a link with which you can fetch the next 20 and so on. This array of image items are looped and filtered by the special tag. We didn&rsquo;t want to sync all the images. So we decided to add a predefined tag <code>#instasync</code> only to those images which we wanted to display on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the first sync, this filtered array is inserted in wpdb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the subsequent syncs, the instagram images are fetched first and are compared with the existing posts. If there is any change in tags or caption then they get updated. The code here is highly optimized and the sync usually takes less then a sec.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we are not downloading the images during the sync but save the urls of the images. We wanted to save the cdn cost. <img alt=\":)\" src=\"http://www.ajaxtown.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" style=\"height:1em\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about the titles ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we had this issue. Instagram doesn&rsquo;t allow you to upload a title. So we decided to add another special tag, <code>#title_{CUSTOM_TITLE}</code>. During the sync process, it extracts the title from this tag and makes this the title of the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the theme have a different posttype ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the posttype is <code>instapost</code>. We wanted to differentiate the instagram posts with the regular posts. The tags and categories for this is posttype are <code>itags</code> and <code>icategories</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the theme customizable ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What ? You asking me, do the birds fly ? The theme is highly customizable. Every part of the theme can be modified from the admin panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the tools used ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grunt, Bower, Git, PhpStorm, Photoshop</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall this was an exciting project to work on. The mobile view has a very nice experience. The sidebar doesn&rsquo;t go below the content like in most responsive website. Instead the main content can can swiped left, to get the sidebar. I am thinking to releasing a free and pro version of this theme. Any thoughts on this ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','2015-05-21 01:32:58','Abhishek Saha',1,'/project/cliptales-wordpress-theme-for-cliptales-com','{\"thumbnail\":\"\",\"normal\":\"\",\"resized\":\"\"}',0,'Cliptales is a wordpress theme integrated with Instagram.

I actually wasn&rsquo;t on a &nbsp;mission to learn, but my interests quite nicely got synced up in the technogical part. I always liked the idea of building something with freedom. And this thought drove me to those areas where&nbsp;I never had a thought I would be a part of. I never had any long term goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Defination Goal:&nbsp;A <em>goal</em> is a desired result that a person or a system envisions, plans and commits to achieve.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>By def. goal looks like a very organised way to reach a point. So, why are goals evil ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hmm. What is the success rate of goals ? Isnt that undefined ? But it depends on factors like consistenacy, interest, will-power, ambition, patience etc. What if you get deflected due to a good opportunity. When one of your goal fails, the others diminish with that. And do you consider the amount of stress you go through&nbsp;if the goals dont match your interest ? Sleep dont come cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is the alternative ?&nbsp;Let go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus more on your present and learn something new. I always had short-term missions and I could achieve them as&nbsp;they were on the line of my interest. I get easily lured to try a new library or a framework or a tool that comes up. I trust the fact that interests are much wiser than setting goals. Life is random and is full of surprises. Its impossible to plan and execute every detail. Stress is obvious. So far I was successful to put&nbsp;stress as an excuse for my other activities, but it didnt&nbsp;serve&nbsp;a purpose. I have not been able to overcome stress but I no more think of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ndash;&nbsp;Campbell</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n','2015-02-20 09:00:44','Abhishek Saha',1,'/article/goals-are-evil','{\"thumbnail\":\"\",\"normal\":\"\",\"resized\":\"\"}',0,'My views on why goals never work.

The website was meant to give information about operating systems. Although there wasn&rsquo;t much traffic, but it was progressing good. I also did social sharing, which helped to get some traffic. Just after 2 weeks, i started generating revenue. Each day i was getting close to 0.8 dollars approx. This was going well for me and my revenue reached to 84 dollars in 3 months. Google pays, once you earn 100 dollars and I was close. But things went down when i received this email.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>It has come to our attention that invalid clicks and/or impressions&nbsp;</em><em>have been generated on the Google ads displayed on your site(s).&nbsp;</em><em>Therefore, we have disabled your Google AdSense account. Please&nbsp;</em><em>understand that this was a necessary step in order to protect the&nbsp;</em><em>interests of AdWords advertisers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>As you may know, a publisher&rsquo;s site may not have invalid clicks or&nbsp;</em><em>impressions on any ad(s), including but not limited to clicks and/or&nbsp;</em><em>impressions generated by:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&ndash; a publisher on his own web pages</em><br />\r\n<em>&ndash; a publisher encouraging other users to click on his/her ads</em><br />\r\n<em>&ndash; automated clicking or surfing programmes, or any other deceptive&nbsp;</em><em>software</em><br />\r\n<em>&ndash; a publisher altering any portion of the ad code or changing the&nbsp;</em><em>layout, behaviour, targeting or delivery of ads for any reason</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>These or any other such activities that violate Google AdSense Terms&nbsp;</em><em>and Conditions and programme polices may have led us to disable your&nbsp;</em><em>account.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>That email was an eye opener. I realised what happened. My system was always connected to a network and sometimes i would access some other computer and click my ad. Also few friends from my office knew this and even they started clicking those ads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google not only keeps &nbsp;track on the ip but also traces and keeps track of the users activities. For example, i use a proxy and click on my ads. At this point Google might not have any idea about my identity. But Google does monitor requests from this IP. So if i am surfing the web and i click an ad which is a Real Estate ad, Google predicts if i was really searching for Real Estate and what i did after clicking that ad. It monitors everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year back, i requested Google to re-activate my google adsense account and i told what what i did honestly. Google replied that they have gone through my appeal and checked my history but to protect the advertisers, they cannot reactivate my account. They also replied further appeals wont be accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I never wanted to use another email id to create adsense. So i tried using services from other ad providers. But they really dont work. They might if you can be smart and if your content is niche but in my case, it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had started publishing youtube videos(technical demos) and i was banned from displaying&nbsp;ads. A week back, i again sent a request to Google and explained my scenario. And to my surprise, yesterday Google emailed me this.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>Hello,</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Thank you for clarifying your situation.

In addition, the use of automated techniques to generate clicks, such as robots or scripts, is prohibited.

For AdMob publishers, when testing your mobile app, you must enable test ads in order to avoid generating invalid clicks.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For AdSense placements, use the Google Publisher Toolbar if you want to click an ad to check the landing page or other details . It will allow you to check the destination of ads on your page without the risk of invalid clicks. For AdMob placements, do not click on live ads on your mobile app. Please use test ads (for Android, iOS, or Windows Phone) to avoid generating invalid clicks.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Please be assured that we are logging all the clicks, so do not click your ads to make sure the clicks are reported in the Performance reports.

[&hellip;]</p>\n','project'),(9,'Dependency Injection in PHP','<p><strong>Dependency Injection</strong>&nbsp;is a software design pattern that allows avoiding hard-coding dependencies and makes possible to change the dependencies both at runtime and compile time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every project will have lots of classes. Few classes will depend on other classes. &nbsp;For example, we have a Library class which gets the name of the books from the database. So our library class is dependent on the database class.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">&lt;?php\r\n\r\ninclude_once \'db.class.php\';\r\n\r\nclass Library {\r\n	\r\n	private $_database;\r\n	\r\n	public function __construct() {\r\n\r\n		$db  = DB::getInstance();\r\n		$this-&gt;_database = $db-&gt;database;\r\n		\r\n	}\r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\n?&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In the above example, &nbsp;the library object will have full access to database which is what we want. But the way, we are providing this access is not great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;Library class&nbsp;is tightly coupled with the&nbsp;Database&nbsp;class, and while this might not look bad on this particular example. Let&rsquo;s imagine that we want to reuse the Library&nbsp;class&nbsp;elsewhere, it will fail if the database class is not included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now lets look at this code.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">&lt;?php\r\n\r\nclass Library {\r\n	\r\n	private $_database;\r\n	\r\n	public function __construct($database) {\r\n\r\n		$this-&gt;_database = $database;\r\n		\r\n	}\r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\n/* And this is how we initiate */\r\n\r\n$lib = new Library($database);\r\n\r\n?&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a nice way of injecting the Database class inside the Library class. &nbsp;And the Library class can now be used in any application. We just have to pass the database object to the Library class to the application. But what if the parameters are more in the constructor ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">$library = new Library($database, $subscriptions, $books);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the time it gets&nbsp;messy. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t like this much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the next good way to take over this situation is by using the&nbsp;<strong>setter injection</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">&lt;?php\r\n\r\nclass Library {\r\n	\r\n	private $_database;\r\n	private $_books;\r\n	\r\n	public function __construct() {}\r\n	\r\n	public function set_database($database) {\r\n		\r\n		$this-&gt;_database = $database;\r\n	\r\n	}\r\n	\r\n	public function set_books($books) {\r\n		\r\n		$this-&gt;_books = $books;\r\n	\r\n	}\r\n\r\n        public function createLibrary() {\r\n		\r\n		return \"Library created from {$this-&gt;_database}\";\r\n	\r\n	}\r\n \r\n}\r\n\r\n/* And this is how we initiate */\r\n\r\n$lib = new Library();\r\n$lib-&gt;set_database($database);\r\n$lib-&gt;set_books($books);\r\n\r\n?&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>This is way too nice and neat. But you will soon realize that over the period of time, this will start smelling bad. If you have to use this class at 5 different places, you will have to initiate this 5 times, writing the same code. That&rsquo;s crap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What now ? We need something that is more robust and can control class initialization at one place. &nbsp;Lets look at the below code.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">class Container {\r\n \r\n	public static $_database;\r\n \r\n	public static function getLibrary() {\r\n \r\n		$library = new Library();\r\n		$library-&gt;set_database(self::$_database);\r\n		$library-&gt;setBooks(new Book);\r\n \r\n		return $library;\r\n	}\r\n \r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can then call this by:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">$library= Container::getLibrary();</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This code is much more flexible and it has lot of benefits. Lets say you want to access books from two different database.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-php\">Container::$_database = \"db1\";\r\n \r\n$library = Container::getLibrary();\r\n$lib1 = $library-&gt;createLibrary();\r\n\r\n\r\n$library-&gt;set_database(\"db2\");\r\n$lib2 = $library-&gt;createLibrary();</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dependency injection really is the answer to more maintainable, testable, modular code. Its very easy to do unit tests with such modular code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to me, the constructor should not be overloaded with parameters. &nbsp;Its better to inject the dependencies as and when required. However few users prefer to pass everything together in the constructor for easy tracing. So this might differ from users to users. Dependency Injection greatly reduces cost in the long run and makes the code highly scalable with less effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n','2014-05-07 12:43:45','Abhishek Saha',1,'/article/dependency-injection-in-php','{\"thumbnail\":\"\",\"normal\":\"\",\"resized\":\"\"}',0,'Dependency Injection is one of the key element for any big application.

Before that, watch the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://playground.ajaxtown.com/link_preview\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How&nbsp;Link Preview&nbsp;works ?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an event listener attached with the input box. The moment an URL is entered, this event listener &nbsp;triggers and sends the URL to the server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the server gets the url and uses meta extraction logics to fetch the meta tags. &nbsp;This information is then passed on back to the client. This cannot be achieved only with the help of javascript because of Cross-Origin problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to implement ?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be implemented in 2 ways. &nbsp;One way is to use the free service which Ajaxtown is providing, &nbsp;And the other way is to download all the files and host them in your server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a file on your server by the name&nbsp;<strong>index.html&nbsp;</strong>and paste the below code. &nbsp;Explanation of the code is written after the code block.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-html\">&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n	&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;\r\n	&lt;script src=&quot;jquery-1.11.0.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n	&lt;script src=&quot;jquery.linkpreview.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n	&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n		\r\n		$(document).ready(function() {\r\n\r\n			$(&quot;#url&quot;).linkpreview({\r\n				image_no: 1,\r\n				outputDiv: $(&quot;#html&quot;),\r\n				loaderDiv: $(&quot;#loader&quot;),\r\n				loaderImg: &#39;indicator_snake.gif&#39;,\r\n				css: true\r\n				//processor: &#39;http://localhost/link_preview/class.linkpreview.php&#39;\r\n			});\r\n\r\n		})\r\n\r\n	&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n	&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n		\r\n		#url {\r\n		    border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;\r\n		    border-radius: 5px;\r\n		    color: #696969;\r\n		    left: 50%;\r\n		    margin-left: -200px;\r\n		    padding: 10px;\r\n		    position: relative;\r\n		    width: 400px;\r\n		}\r\n\r\n		\r\n		#html {\r\n		    left: 50%;\r\n		    margin-left: -250px;\r\n		    position: absolute;\r\n		    top: 100px;\r\n		}\r\n\r\n		body {\r\n			background: #EDEDED;\r\n		}\r\n\r\n		#loader{\r\n			display: block;\r\n		    margin-left: 49%;\r\n		    margin-top: 18px;\r\n		}\r\n\r\n		\r\n	&lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n	&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;url&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter an URL to preview&quot;&gt;\r\n	&lt;span id=&quot;loader&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n	&lt;div id=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lets see what we have done. First we have added two js libraries, jquery and link_preview.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script src=&quot;jquery-1.11.0.min.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;jquery.linkpreview.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next we, initialize the Link_preview plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-javascript\">$(document).ready(function() {\r\n\r\n	$(&quot;#url&quot;).linkpreview({\r\n\r\n		//specify the div id where the preview will be displayed\r\n		outputDiv: $(&quot;#html&quot;),\r\n\r\n		//specify the div id or class where the loader will display\r\n		loaderDiv: $(&quot;#loader&quot;),\r\n\r\n		//image that you want to use as a loader\r\n		loaderImg: &#39;indicator_snake.gif&#39;,\r\n\r\n		// if you want to apply the css along with the html markup\r\n		css: true\r\n\r\n		//this wont be required as you are using Ajaxtown&#39;s service\r\n		//processor: &#39;http://localhost/class.linkpreview.php&#39;\r\n	});			\r\n\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The above snippet is quite explanatory except the commented&nbsp;<em><strong>processor</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>part. If you are using Ajaxtown&rsquo;s free service, you can comment it out. If you want to host this file in your server, uncomment this line and mention the url.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you decide to write your own css, then below is the Link Preview HTML Markup.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div id=&quot;preview&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n		&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot; id=&quot;thumbnail&quot;&gt;\r\n			&lt;img width=&quot;100&quot; data-src = &quot;&quot; src=&quot;&quot;&gt;	\r\n		&lt;/div&gt;		\r\n\r\n		&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot; id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n			&lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n			&lt;span class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n			&lt;span class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n		&lt;/div&gt;\r\n		\r\n		&lt;div id=&quot;toolbar&quot; class=&quot;clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;button id=&quot;changeimg&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next we add the html markup of the input box.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;url&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter an URL to preview&quot;&gt;\r\n	&lt;span id=&quot;loader&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n	&lt;div id=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>I have added some css, to make the above markup a bit more beautiful.

But if you are seriously looking out to make money from theme development, editing theme just won&rsquo;t help. You really need to know in and out of WordPress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Themeforest is a great marketplace to sell your themes. But getting your theme accepted here is really a pain. &nbsp;But if you succeed, you will realize the value of your efforts. I have seen users creating amazing designs but they were rejected forever. My theme Uranium was rejected 9 times which made me hate the reviewers of themeforest. &nbsp;Themeforest community is great and really helpful. There suggestions really helps to uplift the design of your theme to new levels. But even then, it ultimately depends on the reviewers to accept it. I had to leave themeforest unwillingly due to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later I submitted my theme to Mojo with least expectation. I was little worried about the sales. &nbsp;But to my surprise, my theme was very well accepted and it did very well with sales. I found the reviewers very humble and nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must say, that the rejections i had in themeforest were worth.
